# Three year sales report

Power BI was used to create a dashboard which provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data of the organization spanning three years, with a focus on key performance indicators such as total sales, profit, orders, profit margin, and various comparisons. Users can easily understand the overall revenue generated, financial performance, sales patterns, and trends through intuitive visualizations and calculations. By comparing sales by product and month with the previous year, identifying top-performing cities, and analyzing profit by channel and customer, the dashboard offers actionable insights into areas of growth, decline, and opportunities. Additionally, dynamic slicers enable users to personalize their analysis by selecting specific dates, cities, products, and channels, empowering them to make informed decisions based on real-time data.
The organizationâ€™s data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor. DAX calculations were used to create measures and perform complex calculations such as total sales, profit, and profit margin. Finally, we can identify certain trends such as sales trends, comparing performance with previous years, and assessing profit margins across different channels. For instance, in the conclusion for the year 2019, sales decreased by more than 10%.
